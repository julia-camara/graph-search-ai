## Descrição do Projeto

Este projeto tem como objetivo comparar uma abordagem clássica de Inteligência Artificial com uma abordagem moderna baseada em Processamento de Linguagem Natural (PLN), utilizando como base 6 prompts de um banco de dados hospedado no Hugging Face.

Nossa proposta consiste em construir um algoritmo de **busca em grafos utilizando busca em largura (BFS)** — uma técnica clássica de IA. Essa abordagem será então comparada com os resultados obtidos por uma LLM moderna (Large Language Model), utilizando o prompt do ChatGPT. O trabalho busca analisar o desempenho, a coerência e as limitações de cada abordagem, explorando também os diferentes paradigmas de resolução de problemas em IA.

### Exemplo 1 (Parents)
You will be given a graph as a list of directed edges. All nodes are at least degree 1. You will also get a description of an operation to perform on the graph. Your job is to execute the operation on the graph and return the set of nodes that the operation results in. If asked for a breadth-first search (BFS), only return the nodes that are reachable at that depth, do not return the starting node. If asked for the parents of a node, only return the nodes that have an edge leading to the given node, do not return the given node itself.  Here is an example: <begin example>  The graph has the following edges: uvwx -> alke abcd -> uvwx abcd -> efgh efgh -> uvwx  Example 1: Operation: Perform a BFS from node abcd with depth 1. Final Answer: [uvwx, efgh]  Example 2: Operation: Perform a BFS from node alke with depth 1. Final Answer: []  Example 3: Operation: Find the parents of node uvwx. Final Answer: [abcd, efgh]  Example 4: Operation: Find the parents of node abcd. Final Answer: []  <end example> Here is the graph to operate on: The graph has the following edges: cfcd208495 -> cfcd208495 cfcd208495 -> 1679091c5a cfcd208495 -> c81e728d9d cfcd208495 -> c4ca4238a0 c4ca4238a0 -> c9f0f895fb c4ca4238a0 -> 45c48cce2e c4ca4238a0 -> eccbc87e4b c4ca4238a0 -> c9f0f895fb c81e728d9d -> 45c48cce2e c81e728d9d -> eccbc87e4b c81e728d9d -> eccbc87e4b c81e728d9d -> c9f0f895fb eccbc87e4b -> d3d9446802 eccbc87e4b -> d3d9446802 eccbc87e4b -> a87ff679a2 eccbc87e4b -> c4ca4238a0 a87ff679a2 -> 1679091c5a a87ff679a2 -> eccbc87e4b a87ff679a2 -> cfcd208495 a87ff679a2 -> e4da3b7fbb e4da3b7fbb -> c4ca4238a0 e4da3b7fbb -> 1679091c5a e4da3b7fbb -> 1679091c5a e4da3b7fbb -> 45c48cce2e 1679091c5a -> 8f14e45fce 1679091c5a -> 8f14e45fce 1679091c5a -> e4da3b7fbb 1679091c5a -> a87ff679a2 8f14e45fce -> 45c48cce2e 8f14e45fce -> e4da3b7fbb 8f14e45fce -> 8f14e45fce 8f14e45fce -> cfcd208495 c9f0f895fb -> eccbc87e4b c9f0f895fb -> cfcd208495 c9f0f895fb -> eccbc87e4b c9f0f895fb -> 8f14e45fce 45c48cce2e -> cfcd208495 45c48cce2e -> 1679091c5a 45c48cce2e -> a87ff679a2 45c48cce2e -> a87ff679a2 d3d9446802 -> 8f14e45fce d3d9446802 -> d3d9446802 d3d9446802 -> 45c48cce2e d3d9446802 -> e4da3b7fbb   Operation: Find the parents of node 8f14e45fce.  You should immediately return the set of nodes that the operation results in, with no additional text. Return your final answer as a list of nodes in the very last line of your response. For example, if the operation returns the set of nodes [node1, node2, node3], your response should be: Final Answer: [node1, node2, node3] If the operation returns the empty set, your response should be: Final Answer: []
